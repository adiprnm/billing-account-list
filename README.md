## Billing Account List

Copying the billing or bank account list (or maybe another things) are suck. You have to select all it first, then a tooltip contains "Copy" text are shown.

This app solves the problem, at least for me.

This app is 100% local. No database, no fetch request to server. Just client-side app with local storage.

Feel free to modify it as needed. If you like my work, you can [buy me a coffee](https://nihbuatjajan.com/adipurnm).
